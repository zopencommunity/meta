# zopen community Badges

## Introduction

Welcome to the zopen community badge program! These badges are designed to recognize and celebrate the valuable contributions of our members. Whether you are submitting code, improving documentation, or porting essential tools, your efforts help our community grow and thrive. This program, powered by Credly, formally acknowledges that work and showcases the impactful achievements of individuals within our ecosystem.
