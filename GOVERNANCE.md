# zopen Technical Steering Committee (TSC) Structure and Governance

The Technical Steering Committee (TSC) for the zopen community is a group of passionate individuals dedicated to guiding the technical direction and fostering a vibrant open-source community for z/OS.

## Our Mission

Our primary goal is to make z/OS a more open and accessible platform for everyone. We do this by:

*   Curating a rich ecosystem of popular open-source tools.
*   Supporting developers and contributors in the community.
*   Ensuring the long-term health and stability of the zopen community.
*   Making it easier for everyone to contribute to and use open source on the mainframe.

## Responsibilities

The TSC has the following responsibilities:

*   Setting and maintaining the technical direction of the zopen project.
*   Reviewing and approving new project proposals and contributions.
*   Establishing and maintaining project policies and procedures.
*   Managing the project's infrastructure and resources.
*   Resolving technical disputes and making decisions on technical matters.
*   Working to grow the zopen community.

## Members

The current members of the TSC are listed on the [team page](docs/team.md).

### Joining the TSC

The process for appointing any new permanent member of the TSC requires:

1.  A nomination by an existing TSC member.
2.  A two-thirds vote by the full TSC on such an appointment.

Nominations should be made in writing and should include a brief biography of the nominee and a statement of their qualifications.

## Voting

### In Meetings

Decisions in TSC meetings are made by consensus. If consensus cannot be reached, a vote is held. A simple majority is required for a motion to pass.

### Outside of Meetings

The quorum for voting outside of meetings is defined in the TSC charter. Voting will be held in the TSC's designated communication channel. A two-thirds majority is required for a motion to pass.
